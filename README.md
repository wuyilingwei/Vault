# Vault Service

A personal lightweight SaaS service light database, supporting complex permission management. Designed for high-performance credential distribution and configuration sharing across devices.

*The entire design is based on Cloudflare worker + KV + D1

## Features

* **Low Latency Auth**: < 50ms authentication response via KV edge caching.
* **Data Security**: UUID-based module-level permission control.
* **Reliable Storage**: Configuration items persisted in Cloudflare D1.
* **Batch Operations**: Supports atomic batch read/write operations to reduce network round-trips.
* **Lightweight Frontend**: Includes a Vue-based frontend for token management.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed.
* Cloudflare account.
* Wrangler CLI installed (`npm install -g wrangler`).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wuyilingwei/Vault.git
   cd Vault
   ```
2. **Configure Wrangler**

   Create a copy of the configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp wrangler.example.toml wrangler.toml
   ```
3. **Create Resources**

   Create the KV namespace for authentication:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler kv:namespace create vault-access
   ```

   Create the D1 database for data storage:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 create vault-service
   ```

   **Important**: Update your `wrangler.toml` file with the `id` (for KV) and `database_id` (for D1) returned by the commands above.
4. **Set Admin Password**

   Set the administrator password used for the frontend management interface:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD
   ```
5. **Initialize Database**

   Initialize the D1 database schema using the provided SQL file:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 execute vault-service --file=./init.sql
   ```
6. **Deploy**

   Deploy the worker to Cloudflare:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

## Usage

Once deployed, you can access the frontend at your worker's URL (e.g., `https://vault-service.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`).

Use the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set to log in and manage tokens and permissions.
